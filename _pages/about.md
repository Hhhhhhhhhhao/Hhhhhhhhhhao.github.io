Hao Chen is currently a master student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his bachelor of science degree in Automation at the Tianjin University and bachelor of engineering degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in the Univsersity of Edinburgh in 2019. His primiary reshearch interests lie in deep learning and computer vision. More specificially, he is interested in developing self-supervised/unsupervised algorithms for computer vision tasks and multi-modal learning combining vision and language. His previous research experience mainly are related to Image Inpainting, Generative Adversarial Networks, Semi-supvised Learning/Self-supervised Learning, 3D Human Reconstrution, and Vision and Language.
